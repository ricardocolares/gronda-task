# Gronda task

Some of the technologies I used to develop this challenge are:

- React Native
- Testing Library
- React Query (to fetch data and caching)
- Mirage.js (to mock a server)

# Run the app

1.  Install dependencies: `yarn`
2.  run metro bundler: `yarn start`
3.  run the app: ` yarn android`

## Run tests

    yarn test

## Missing features

1.  Move state logic to a custom hook using useReducer to make the app features more scalable
2.  Create more tests use cases
